  <p>Dear <strong>{{clientName}}</strong>,</p>
  <p>
    We are pleased to inform you that
    <strong>Week 4</strong>
    of your EB-1A petition development has now been successfully completed.
  </p>
  <p>
    During this phase, our team finalized the
    <strong>Final Merits Determination</strong>
    and crafted the
    <strong>Conclusion Section</strong>
    of your petition. This stage consolidates all the strength signals gathered
    from your achievements, criteria evidence, U.S. benefit narrative, and legal
    argumentation, aligning them into a compelling concluding position
    consistent with USCIS adjudication standards.
