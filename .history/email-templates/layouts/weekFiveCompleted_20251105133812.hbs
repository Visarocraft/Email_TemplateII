  <p>Dear <strong>{{clientName}}</strong>,</p>
  <p>
    We are pleased to notify you that
    <strong>Week 5</strong>
    of your EB-1A petition development has now been successfully completed.
  </p>
  <p>
    During this stage, our team carried out the full
    <strong>Exhibits Collation & Final Review Process</strong>, ensuring that
    every evidence item included in your petition has been properly referenced,
    numbered, indexed, and aligned to its respective USCIS criteria and petition
    narrative section.
  </p>

  > Next Step: </h3>
  <p>
    We now move into the
    <strong>Filing Preparation Phase</strong>, where the petition will be
    structured into its final submission package format in readiness for
    dispatch to USCIS.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there are any final materials you still wish to provide, they must be
    uploaded immediately; after filing format preparation begins, additional
    additions may no longer be possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for your continued cooperation, consistency, and responsiveness.
    We are getting closer to the final submission milestone.
  </p>
