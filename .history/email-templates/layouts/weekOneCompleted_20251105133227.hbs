    Our team has fully reviewed the documents you submitted and we have

    according to the relevant
    <strong>USCIS EB-1A</strong>
    criteria.

    This stage has given us a strong structural understanding of your profile,
    your evidentiary strengths, and the areas where narrative amplification will
    yield the highest impact.
